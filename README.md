# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
Introduction :
The Face Attendance System is an open-source Python project that leverages computer vision and facial recognition to automate attendance marking. This project offers a practical solution for educational institutions and organizations seeking efficient attendance management.
How It Works
The system uses OpenCV, NumPy, and the face_recognition library to capture real-time video from a webcam. It detects faces in the video feed and compares them with known faces from a database. If a match is found, the system marks the attendance for the recognized individual by recording their name and the timestamp in an Excel file. It checks for duplicate entries to prevent multiple markings.

Tech Stack :
Python
OpenCV
NumPy
face_recognition
openpyxl (for Excel integration)

Benefits :
Efficiency: Automates attendance marking, reducing the administrative burden.
Accuracy: Utilizes facial recognition for precise identification.
Data Storage: Records attendance in an Excel file for easy access and data management.
Prevents Duplicates: Ensures each individual is marked only once per session.
